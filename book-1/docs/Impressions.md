## 1. Install/upgrade
easy install manual, but not perfect tooling. So confused information about upgrading Golang, I can't do after 4-5 pages from google search. Uninstall/Install process for upgrading seems as bad decision.

## 2. simple function syntax
```
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```
Why func ? Why not just: 
```
function main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```
or just:
```
main(){
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

Something like you're not so lazy to type "function" but after 4 characters you realize that you're a little bit lazy anyway, so you just type "func" :D

## 3. Variable naming in book
In chapter 4 author tell you that variable naming very important. In chapter 5 you see "i" variables everywhere.
